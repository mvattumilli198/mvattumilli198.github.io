      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The Horizon Retention &amp; Success Hub is an early-noticing platform that pulls together data
          that usually lives in separate university systems. It combines academic records, course
          enrollments, learning management system (LMS) activity, attendance logs, and financial indicators
          for about 5,000 synthetic students across four terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of this data foundation, we trained a multi-class XGBoost model that predicts whether a
          student in a given term is at Low, Medium, or High academic risk. The model reaches roughly
          92 percent accuracy on held-out test data. Its predictions are written into a
          <code>riskscores</code> table so that the backend can read risk tiers just like any other column.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around this model, we built a full application stack. The Spring Boot backend exposes REST
          endpoints with JWT-based authentication and role checks. The React frontend provides separate
          experiences for advisors and students. Advisors scan high-risk students, drill into term-by-term
          profiles, and log advising notes. Students see their GPA trends, attendance, engagement metrics,
          and a plain-language explanation of their risk tier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the dataset is synthetic, the workflow from data model to dashboards is intentionally
          close to commercial student-success platforms that many universities use today.

          <h3>Why this problem exists</h3>
          <p>
            Universities are under pressure to improve retention and graduation rates, but information
            about students is scattered across grade books, LMS logs, attendance systems, financial aid
            records, and advising notes. In many cases, advisors only realize that a student is in trouble
            once the student is already failing courses or has stopped attending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core issue is the lack of a unified, intelligent view that combines academic, behavioral,
            and financial signals into something advisors and students can act on in time.
          </p>

            <h4>Academic Advisors</h4>

              the existing APIs.

          <li>
            Drops in attendance and LMS activity often appear before GPA drops, so they can be useful
            early warning signals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single metrics like GPA on its own are weak predictors. Models work better when they combine
            performance, engagement, and financial stress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dashboards that only display data without thresholds, flags, or next steps are less likely to
            change advisor behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk scores are sensitive. Fairness, transparency, and interpretation should be treated as
            core design concerns and not just technical details.

          Risk scores can shape how advisors perceive students. In a real deployment, the model should be
          audited regularly for differences across groups such as gender, residency status, or first-generation
          status. Scores should be treated as support signals and never as labels of student ability.

        <h3>Privacy and FERPA</h3>
        <p>
          Our prototype uses only synthetic data. In production, strict access control, encryption, and
          compliance with FERPA and institutional policy would be required. Role-based access in our design
          is one step in that direction, with different views for advisors and students.
        </p>

        <h3>Interpretability</h3>
        <p>
          We intentionally present simple metrics and a discrete risk tier instead of an opaque number.
          Future versions could integrate explainable AI techniques so that advisors can see which features
          contributed most to a given student's risk classification.

        <p>
          Building the Horizon Retention &amp; Success Hub gave our team a realistic end-to-end view of a
          data product. We went from synthetic data generation and schema design to feature engineering,
          model training, backend APIs, and user-facing dashboards.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the technical side, we deepened our understanding of Spring Boot, JWT-based authentication,
          and secure frontend to backend integration. On the analytical side, we worked with multi-class
          classification, evaluation metrics, and the tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we also saw how important early alignment is. Agreeing on architecture, shared
          vocabulary, and user stories before writing code helped avoid rework. Iterating on dashboard
          designs and reviewing each other's work turned a set of scripts and mockups into a coherent
          product.
