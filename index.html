            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Horizon Retention &amp; Success Hub</strong> is a
              web-based early-alert platform designed to help a university identify
              and support students who are at risk of struggling academically.
              The system brings together fragmented data from multiple sources
              (grades, LMS activity, attendance, financial indicators, and advising notes)
              into a single, actionable view for academic advisors and students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using a synthetic dataset of about 5,000 students across four terms,
              we engineered features from 11 tables and trained a multi-class
              XGBoost model to classify each student-term record as
              <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or <em>High</em> risk.
              The model reached roughly 92% accuracy on held-out test data.
              These predictions are stored in PostgreSQL and exposed through
              a Spring Boot API.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the frontend, a React application provides separate dashboards
              for advisors and students. Advisors can quickly scan high-risk
              students, drill into a profile, and view or add advising notes.
              Students can see their own GPA trends, attendance and engagement
              summaries, and simple recommendations. While all data is synthetic,
              the workflow mirrors real student-success platforms and can be
              adapted to real institutional contexts.

            <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Universities are under pressure to improve student retention and graduation
              rates, but the information needed to spot students who are slipping behind
              is scattered across multiple systems. Advisors may see grades in one
              interface, attendance in another, LMS activity in a different portal, and
              financial indicators elsewhere. Without a unified, intelligent view, at-risk
              students may only be noticed after failing multiple courses or disengaging
              completely.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Academic Advisors:</strong> need an integrated view of each
                student’s performance, engagement, and history of interventions to decide
                whom to reach out to first and how to support them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Students:</strong> often see information in fragments; they
                benefit from a clear, single dashboard that shows where they stand and
                what they can do next.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>University Leadership:</strong> cares about trends by major,
                term, and risk segment; while our prototype focuses on advisor and
                student views, the architecture is ready for institutional analytics.

              a React frontend, a Spring Boot REST API, and a PostgreSQL database.
              An offline Python pipeline (Pandas + XGBoost) generates risk scores that
              are imported into the <code>riskscores</code> table.

              tiers. The model is evaluated on a stratified 80/20 split and then used to
              score all 20,000 student-term rows.

            <p>
              The advisor dashboard opens with key metrics such as total students,
              High-risk student count, average term GPA, and average attendance.
              Below, a table lists students with their major, current term GPA,

            </p>
            <p>
              Advisors can filter by risk tier or GPA and click into a student profile

            <ul>
              <li>
                High-risk students tend to show both lower attendance and lower LMS
                engagement than peers, even before grades drop sharply.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students with higher financial stress indicators also appear more
                frequently in Medium and High risk tiers, suggesting the value of
                pairing academic and financial support.
              </li>
              <li>
                The dashboard makes these patterns visible at a glance so advisors can
                prioritize outreach and track whether risk levels improve over time.

            <p>
              In a real deployment, risk models must be evaluated for fairness across
              demographic groups, such as gender, residency status, or first-generation
              status. Risk scores should be treated as signals for support, not as
              labels of student potential or worth.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Privacy &amp; Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              Our prototype uses synthetic data only. For actual student data, strict
              controls, audit logs, and compliance with FERPA would be essential.
              We deliberately expose relatively simple metrics (GPA, attendance,
              engagement, and risk tier) to keep the system understandable to both
              advisors and students.
