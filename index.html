        <p>
          The Horizon Retention &amp; Success Hub is an early-noticing platform that
          pulls together information that usually lives in separate university systems:
          academic records, course enrollments, learning management system (LMS) usage,
          attendance logs, and financial indicators. The project uses a fully synthetic
          dataset of about 5,000 students over four academic terms, designed to mimic
          realistic behavior without exposing real student data.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of this data foundation, we trained a multi-class XGBoost model that
          predicts whether a student in a given term is at <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or
          <em>High</em> academic risk. The model reaches roughly 92% accuracy on held-out
          test data. Its predictions are written into a <code>riskscores</code> table so
          that the backend can query risk tiers just like any other column.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the model, we built a full application stack: a Spring Boot backend with
          JWT-based authentication and REST APIs, and a React frontend with separate
          advisor and student experiences. Advisors can scan high-risk students, drill
          into longitudinal profiles, and capture advising notes. Students see a compact
          view of their GPA trend, attendance, engagement, and a plain-language
          explanation of their risk tier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the data is artificial, the overall workflow—data model, machine
          learning pipeline, APIs, and dashboards—is intentionally close to commercial
          student-success platforms used in higher education.

          <h3>Why this problem matters</h3>
          <p>
            Universities are under pressure to improve retention and graduation rates,
            but information about students is scattered across grade books, LMS logs,
            attendance systems, financial aid, and advising notes. In many cases,
            advisors only notice that a student is in trouble once they are failing
            multiple courses or have stopped showing up—at which point it is much harder
            to change the trajectory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core problem is the absence of a unified, intelligence-supported view
            that combines academic, behavioral, and financial signals into something
            advisors and students can act on.
          </p>

          <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
          <div class="stakeholder">
            <h4>Academic Advisors</h4>
            <p>
              Need an integrated view that answers questions like:
              “Who is most at risk right now?”, “What has changed across recent terms?”,
              and “What interventions have already been tried?”

              See grades in one place, billing in another, and attendance feedback
              somewhere else. A single, honest dashboard helps them understand where
              they stand and why.

              advising resources are aligned with need. Our architecture leaves room

        <h3>What the literature says</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Early signals matter: drops in attendance and LMS activity often appear
            before GPA declines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single metrics (like GPA alone) are weak predictors; combining performance,
            engagement, and financial stress leads to better models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dashboards must be actionable, not just pretty—users need thresholds,
            flags, and next steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk scores are sensitive artifacts; fairness, transparency, and
            interpretation are part of the design, not an afterthought.
          </li>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fairness &amp; Bias</h3>
        <p>
          Risk scores can influence how advisors perceive and prioritize students.
          In a real deployment, the model would need to be regularly audited for
          disparate impact across demographics such as gender, residency, or
          first-generation status, and risk tiers should be treated as support signals,
          not labels of student capability.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy &amp; FERPA</h3>
        <p>
          Our prototype uses only synthetic data. In production, strong access control,
          encryption, and compliance with FERPA and institutional policies would be
          required. Role-based access in our design (advisor vs. student) is one step
          toward that.
        </p>

        <h3>Interpretability</h3>
        <p>
          We intentionally present simple metrics (GPA, attendance, engagement) and a
          discrete risk tier instead of a mysterious score. Future iterations could add
          explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP) so advisors can see which factors are
          driving a student’s risk classification.

        <p>
          Building the Horizon Retention &amp; Success Hub gave the team a realistic
          end-to-end view of a data product: from synthetic data generation and schema
          design to feature engineering, model training, backend APIs, and frontend
          dashboards.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the technical side, we deepened our understanding of Spring Boot,
          JWT-based authentication, and secure frontend–backend integration. On the
          analytics side, we worked with multi-class classification, evaluation
          metrics, and the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we also experienced how important early alignment is—agreeing on
          architecture, shared vocabulary, and user stories before diving into code.
          Iterating on dashboard design and reviewing each other’s work helped move the
          project from a collection of scripts to a coherent product.
